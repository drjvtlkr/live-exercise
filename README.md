# live-exercise

A warm welcome everyone,
This file will act as a guide to this particular repository. 
Also this repo will act as dumpyard of all the trial and errors that I will be making throught the period of 5 days, i.e till I submit my projects. 



the inconsistent fellow in me has made this a pretty difficult task to amke this a relaity. Work 6-7 hrs a day to complete projectsin the next 4-5 days is going to be a pain in the head. So this is the perfect time to me to show that I can perfporm wellin the times of crisis or emergency.

Documenting all this is a secret stach to my code harem
